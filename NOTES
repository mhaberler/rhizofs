errno thread safety
    Yes, errno is thread-safe on all platforms that support POSIX
    threads, *provided* you compile your code correctly.
    How to do so depends on the platform. On Solaris, compile with
    -D_REENTRANT, on AIX with -D_THREAD_SAFE. On Linux, compile with
    '-pthread' (though Linux errno is thread-safe by default).

errno portability
    maybe replace with custom errorcodes in the protocol

errnos in
    asm-generic/errno-base.h
    asm-generic/errno.h
